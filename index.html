                <strong>Lesson Overview:</strong> Half the class presents their creative literary work developed through human-AI collaboration throughout the course. Each student shares a brief introduction to their work, reads or summarizes a selected excerpt, and offers one reflection on what they learned through the creative process. The focus is celebration and appreciation, not critique or evaluation. Classmates practice active listening and offer specific, positive responses using appreciation prompts ("I liked the part where...", "Your voice really came through when...", "I'm curious about..."). This is the culmination of the authentic voice theme—students share the voices they've developed while remaining the author and director of their AI-assisted creative work. The lesson models how creative communities support each other through appreciative listening and honoring the courage it takes to share.
