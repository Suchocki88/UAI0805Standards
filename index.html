                <strong>Lesson Overview:</strong> Students complete their reflection essays examining their creative process and what they learned through human-AI collaboration on their literary project (short story, novella, play, poetry collection, etc.). The reflection essay is written without AI assistance, demonstrating that knowing when to work independently is itself an AI literacy skill. Students address three areas: the collaboration process (how they worked with Alia, what worked, what didn't), their authentic voice (where it appears in the work, how they handled moments when AI output felt "not quite them"), and what they learned (about AI capabilities/limitations, about their own creative process, about human-AI collaboration going forward). The reflection essay is turned in for a grade. Students may also prepare for upcoming sharing day presentations. This lesson synthesizes the creative project strand that has run alongside course content throughout the semester.
